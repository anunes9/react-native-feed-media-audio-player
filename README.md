# react-native-audio-player

This is the repository for our React Native bridge that allows
a React Native app to control our native audio players via
Javascript.

This repo contains our bridge plus an example app that we use
for development. The bridge code that is published to NPM
exists [in the `package` directory](https://github.com/feedfm/react-native-feed-media-audio-player/tree/master/package).

To use the library, run the following in your React Native app:

```
npm install react-native-feed-media-audio-player
cd ios
pod install
```

Look in the `example` dir in this repo to see an example app
that uses the player.
